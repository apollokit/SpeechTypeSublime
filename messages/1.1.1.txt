TypeShort v1.1.1 changelog:

New features:

- Add debug options

      Some packages' syntax is just not the same with the one shown in the
  bottom-right window of ST. By turning on the "debug" option of TypeShort,
  syntaxes/scopes match at current cursor will show in a popup message.

      For an example, while using the "Laravel Blade Highlighter" package, the
  bottom-right window of ST shows "Laravel Blade" but, in fact, its syntax is
  "blade".
